Documentation for Barry's Enigma simulator
==========================================

* Design decisions
** Which class should "own" the rotor positions?
The machine class should own the positions of the rotors
The rotor class should own the ring setting

* Notes
A ring setting of 'Z' is actually the "default" setting (not 'A' !!!)
